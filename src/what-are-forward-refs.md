22. ### What are forward refs?

    _Ref forwarding_ is a feature that lets some components take a _ref_ they receive, and pass it further down to a child.

    ```jsx harmony
    const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
      <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
        {props.children}
      </button>
    ));

    // Create ref to the DOM button:
    const ref = React.createRef();
    <ButtonElement ref={ref}>{"Forward Ref"}</ButtonElement>;
    ```
