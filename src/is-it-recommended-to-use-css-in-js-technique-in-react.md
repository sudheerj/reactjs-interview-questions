301. ### Is it recommended to use CSS In JS technique in React?
     React does not have any opinion about how styles are defined but if you are a beginner then good starting point is to define your styles in a separate \*.css file as usual and refer to them using className. This functionality is not part of React but came from third-party libraries. But If you want to try a different approach(CSS-In-JS) then styled-components library is a good option.
