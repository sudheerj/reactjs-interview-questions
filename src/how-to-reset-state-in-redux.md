163. ### How to reset state in Redux?

     You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.

     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```

     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => {
           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`);
         });

         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```
