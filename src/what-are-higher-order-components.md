36. ### What are Higher-Order Components?

    A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

    We call them **pure components** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

    ```javascript
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
    ```

    HOC can be used for many use cases:

    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
    2. Render hijacking.
    3. State abstraction and manipulation.
    4. Props manipulation.
