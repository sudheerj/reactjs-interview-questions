49. ### What are portals in React?

    _Portal_ is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
    ```

    The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element.
