306. ### Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in `useState`?

     When we declare a state variable with `useState`, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

     For example, the array index access would look as follows:

     ```javascript
     var userStateVariable = useState("userProfile"); // Returns an array pair
     var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
     var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
     ```

     Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:

     ```javascript
     const [user, setUser] = useState("userProfile");
     ```
