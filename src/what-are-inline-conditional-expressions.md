18. ### What are inline conditional expressions?

    You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`.

    ```jsx harmony
    <h1>Hello!</h1>;
    {
      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      ) : (
        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
      );
    }
    ```
