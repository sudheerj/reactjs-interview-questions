40. ### How to write comments in React?

    The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

    **Single-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```

    **Multi-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Multi-line comments for more than
       one line */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```
