77. ### What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method?

    The new static `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or `null` to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillReceiveProps()`.
