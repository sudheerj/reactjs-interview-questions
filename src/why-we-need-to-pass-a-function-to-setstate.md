83. ### Why we need to pass a function to setState()?

    The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

    ```javascript
    // assuming this.state.count === 0
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    // this.state.count === 1, not 3
    ```

    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.

    ```javascript
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      count: prevState.count + props.increment,
    }));
    // this.state.count === 3 as expected
    ```

    **(OR)**

    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

    This counter example will fail to update as expected:

    ```javascript
    // Wrong
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
    });
    ```

    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

    ```javascript
    // Correct
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
    }));
    ```
