30. ### What are controlled components?

    A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **Controlled Component**, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

    For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

    ```javascript
    handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
    }
    ```
