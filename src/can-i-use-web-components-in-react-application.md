272. ### Can I use web components in react application?

     Yes, you can use web components in a react application. Even though many developers won't use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.

     For example, let us use `Vaadin` date picker web component as below,

     ```javascript
     import React, { Component } from "react";
     import "./App.css";
     import "@vaadin/vaadin-date-picker";
     class App extends Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div className="App">
             <vaadin-date-picker label="When were you born?"></vaadin-date-picker>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     export default App;
     ```
