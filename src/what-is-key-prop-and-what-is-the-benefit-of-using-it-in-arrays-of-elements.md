19. ### What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?

    A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);
    ```

    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>
    ));
    ```

    **Note:**

    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.
    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.
    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.
